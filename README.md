Web Testing Demo 

Tools used:
 1- Selenium WebDriver
 2- Maven (Dependcnies manager)
 3- TestNG (Trigger test cases)
 
Note: I've created a input.properties file that the script will read data from to start a specific browser, invoke the URL and website username. 
Please modify the file path acording to your setup prior to executing the script.
